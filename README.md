This project was Challenge 3 of The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp on Udemy. The challenge was to create a Blog Website that tests my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and Embedded JavaScript.

## How To Use
* Download the project and navigate to the project folder in your terminal.
* Install all dependencies using npm or yarn.
* Type npm start or yarn start in the terminal.

## Mess Around With It
